# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction for Auto-Insurance Companies

## Business Problem
An Auto Insurance company X in the USA is facing issues in retaining its customers and wants to advertise promotional offers for its loyal customers. They are considering Customer Lifetime Value CLV as a parameter for this purpose. <br>
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) signifies the worth of a customer to a company across a specified duration.  In the insurance sector, where competition is intense, customers consider more than just insurance premiums when making decisions.  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), being centered on the customer, offers a strong foundation for retaining high-value clients, earning more from lower-valued clients, and improving overall customer satisfaction. Effectively leveraging CLV can result in better customer acquisition and retention, decreased churn rates, informed marketing budget planning, detailed ad performance measurement, and numerous other advantages.

## Dataset Description
The dataset represents Customer lifetime value of an Auto Insurance industry in the United States, it includes over 24 features and 9134 records to analyze the lifetime value of Customer.

We have the data of insurers from 5 states in North America â€” Washington, California, Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon. The data consists of 8 continuous variables and 15 categorical variables which are one-hot encoded for applying ML models. Among the variables, Customer (unique identifier) and Effective To Date are discarded as they are irrelevant to our analysis

## What is CLV?
Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a business metric used to determine the amount of money customers will spend on your products or service over time.

For example, if someone is loyal to an auto brand whose vehicles average at $30,000 and the customer buys three cars from them in their lifetime, their CLV is $90,000. Whereas, someone who visits their local coffee chain five days a week and spends $4 on a coffee, will have a CLV of $10,400 over the course of 10 years.
